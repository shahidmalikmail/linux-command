Hi way2srinivas,
There is an inaccuracy in the amazon-efs-utils installation documentation for deb packages. We will be addressing the documentation inaccuracy shortly. In the meantime, please use the following commands:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y git binutils make
git clone https://github.com/aws/efs-utils
cd efs-utils
make deb
sudo apt-get install -y ./build/amazon-efs-utils*deb
