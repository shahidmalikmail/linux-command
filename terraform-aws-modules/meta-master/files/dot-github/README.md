# .github - a hidden gem in repository management

All github meta files are stored here and automatically linked from all repositories in [terraform-aws-modules organization](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules).

## Missing features, bugs, to-dos:

- Content of `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` is not available in repositories. Bug? Feature? I don't know, because I can't find any documentation about this.

## Why?

I learned about `.github` repository during GitHub Satellite 2019 in Berlin. I have been thinking about ways to reduce copy-pasting between similar repositories for several years.
