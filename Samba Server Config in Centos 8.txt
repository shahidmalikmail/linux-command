If you use the passdb backend = tdbsam default setting, Samba stores user accounts in the /var/lib/samba/private/passdb.tdb database.

Procedure

Create the operating system account:

# useradd -M -s /sbin/nologin example
This command adds the example account without creating a home directory. If the account is only used to authenticate to Samba, assign the /sbin/nologin command as shell to prevent the account from logging in locally.

Set a password to the operating system account to enable it:

# passwd example
Enter new UNIX password: password
Retype new UNIX password: password
passwd: password updated successfully
Samba does not use the password set on the operating system account to authenticate. However, you need to set a password to enable the account. If an account is disabled, Samba denies access if this user connects.

Add the user to the Samba database and set a password to the account:

# smbpasswd -a example
New SMB password: password
Retype new SMB password: password
Added user example.
Use this password to authenticate when using this account to connect to a Samba share.

Enable the Samba account:

# smbpasswd -e example
Enabled user example.
