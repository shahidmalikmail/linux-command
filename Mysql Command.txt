GRANT permission1, permission2 ON database_name.table_name TO 'database_user'@'localhost';

Grand all privileges to a user account over a specific database:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO 'database_user'@'localhost';

Grand all privileges to a user account over all databases:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'database_user'@'localhost';

Grand all privileges to a user account over a specific table from a database:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.table_name TO 'database_user'@'localhost';

Grant multiple privileges to a user account over a specific database:
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, DELETE ON database_name.* TO database_user@'localhost';

Create a new MySQL User Account
CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'user_password';

To grant access from another host change the hostname part (localhost) with the remote machine IP. For example, to grant access from a machine with IP 10.8.0.5 you would run:
CREATE USER 'newuser'@'10.8.0.5' IDENTIFIED BY 'user_password';

CREATE DATABASE database_name;    (For CREATE any new database in mysql
