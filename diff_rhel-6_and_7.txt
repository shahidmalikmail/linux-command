reboot – init 6

RHEL 7 – systemctl poweroff
systemctl reboot

YUM Commands
RHEL 6 -yum groupinstall
yum groupinfo

RHEL 7 – yum group install
yum group info

Extracting Initramfs Image
RHEL 6 – gunzip
gunzip -c /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img | cpio -i -d

RHEL 7 – skipcpio
/usr/lib/dracut/skipcpio /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img | gunzip -c | cpio -id

Default Inode Size
RHEL 6 – 256 bytes

[root@local ~]# tune2fs -l /dev/sda1|grep -i ‘inode size’

Inode size: 128

RHEL 7 – 512 bytes

[root@managed1 ]# xfs_info /dev/sda1|grep isize

meta-data=/dev/sda1 isize=512 agcount=4, agsize=65536 blks

Iostat Command
Now, in RHEL7.x there is a separate r_await (read await) & w_await (write await) added along with “await” which produces total (changed in sysstat version 10). It is just “await” parameter to get total average time in milliseconds which took to complete IO requests in case of RHEL6.x version.

Network Persistent Device File
RHEL 6 – maintains persistent in network/device
RHEL 7 – maintains persistent in /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-network.rules

Free Command
RHEL 6 – used = total – free
RHEL 7 – used = total – free – buff/cache

Resizing an Lvm
RHEL 6 – EXT family of file systems could be resized if built on a logical volume as a block device.

RHEL 7 – As with XFS file system, resize is not possible.

Dmesg Command
RHEL 6 – “dmesg” command belongs to “util-linux-ng” package and which by default doesn’t record time stamp and hence, data produced doesn’t state when those messages are generated.

RHEL 7 – The new “util-linux” package to which “dmesg” command belongs to can print time-stamp along with messages as storaged in /var/log/dmesg. Now, users can print human readable kernel ring buffer messages using “dmesg -T” command. Most of the user utility commands under /bin are moved to /usr/bin in RHEL7.x architecture.
